This was supposed to be a Jekyll version of the "Future Imperfect" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/). However I could not get it to work as the original set up doesn't have a config file and I couldn't figure out how to get the pages to load correctly. My current set up will rely on manual html coding despite th jekyll infrastructure utnil I heart back from @ajlkn.
