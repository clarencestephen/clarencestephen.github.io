									<i>The Financial Singularity & Machine Learning in Financial Markets</i>
									<p></p>
									<p>For starters, what is a singularity? The scientific term refers to the physical region beyond the event horizon of a black hole--an area of infinitely increasing gravity created by the implosion of a dying star.</p>
									<img src="images/blackhole.png" align="middle" alt="" width="477" height="346" />
									<p></p>
									<p>As a mass approaches this region it inevitably heads deeper and deeper into the black hole, accelerating and simultaneous gaining mass, eventually becoming infinitely fast and infinitely heavy and then finally: <i><b> all known laws of physics break down </b></i> and the complete nature of a singularity can thus never be fully understood.</p>
									<img src="images/singularitygraph.png" align="middle" alt="" width="717" height="352" />
									<p></p>
									<p>So what is the financial singularity? If you’re familiar with Moore’s Law and Neilson’s law, this concept is an extension of the implications of that exponential growth. The term ‘financial singularity’ is a derivative of a term coined by Vernor Vinge, an American sci-fi author and retired professor of mathematics and computer science at San Diego State University. Vinge referred to the technological singularity. A belief that the evolution of human intelligence is advancing at a rate that will soon be able to create intelligences that rival our own.</p>
									<img src="images/Ray_Kurzweil.png" align="middle" alt="" width="750" height="402" />
									<p></p>
									<p>Ray Kurzweil, Google’s Director of Engineering, is credited with the term financial singularity and stated to Futurism: </p>
									<blockquote> “2029 is the consistent date I have predicted for when an AI will pass a valid Turing test and therefore achieve human levels of intelligence. I have set the date 2045 for the ‘Singularity’ which is when we will multiply our effective intelligence a billion fold by merging with the intelligence we have created.” </blockquote>
									<p>Kurzweil has an impressive track-record…how impressive? How’s 86% accuracy out of 147 predictions since the 90s seem to you?</p>
									<img src="images/techgrow.png" align="middle" alt="" width="714" height="490" />
									<p></p>
									<p>To evaluate the risk of a financial singularity, we must first look at technology today. No doubt we have progressed at what is perceived to be a consistently, increasing rate. When we look at financial technology today (herein: FinTech), already some of the larger trading houses like Blackrock, Two Sigma, Renaissance technologies and others are employing Artificial Intelligence for picking stocks and as a result, firing human stock pickers. Companies like JP Morgan and IBM are trying to bring AI into financial regulations and compliance to make things easier.</p>
									<img src="images/hftshare.png" align="middle" alt="" width="584" height="418" />
									<p></p>
									<p>Already we are seeing algorithmic/automated trading taking a lion’s share of market activity. The more traditional algorithms, a list of commands and rules to use in specific scenarios, are not AI but they represent data-driven, systematic approaches to trading and, as we will discuss, carrying an apparent risk to financial stability long term in concert with AI.</p>
									<img src="images/fintecheco.png" align="middle" alt="" width="792" height="437" />
									<p></p>
									<p>As tech meshes with financial technologies the lines become blurred and the foundational data for trading/investing becomes wider and deeper. Is there any cause for concern yet?</p>
									<img src="images/flashcrash.png" align="middle" alt="" width="810" height="526" />
									<p></p>
									<p>Perhaps just a little? These market dislocations, aptly named ‘Flash Crashes” are caused by “rogue” algorithmic trading. I contrast this with the following period of extended market declines in China:</p>
									<img src="images/chinacrash.png" align="middle" alt="" width="638" height="475" />
									<p></p>
									<p>This chart shows the July’15 market correction in China. During this time the government intervened a little…by a little I mean leverage restrictions, trading restrictions, direct market purchases of stocks to support the broader markets, adjusting Yuan parity, etc. etc. THIS IS HUMAN! Without a doubt this price action is what a “healthy” market looks like with all the ups and downs associated with human error, judgment, and emotions.</p>
									<p>Yale Economics, Robert Schiller, takes a different perspective: ““Human judgment, good and bad, will drive investment decisions and financial-market outcomes for the rest of our lives and beyond.”  Ironically, Robert Schiller also asked “Will alpha eventually go to zero for every imaginable investment strategy?.” The latter statement is more in line with the idea of financial singularity.</p>
									<img src="images/noai.png" align="middle" alt="" width="704" height="275" />
									<p></p>
									<p>To emphasize the debate at hand, we should differentiate between “real AI” or otherwise. The work-flow above shows what methods are typically employed in the market today.  This contracts with ‘real’ AI should have no strategy inputs, no training (supervised or unsupervised), and be able to attain data and make decisions independently of the creators input. This is not what investment managers are doing today (as far as we can know).</p>
									<p>This contrasts greatly with what real AI looks like; namely Google’s AlphaGo & Elon Musk’s OpenAI. In both cases, the computer is given only the minimum input—the rules of the game—and must teach itself strategy, winning, losing, with only its own experiences to build on. In both situations, the AI were able to beat the world champion of Go & DOTA (respectively) in record time: </p>
									<img src="images/alphago1.gif" align="middle" alt="" width="720" height="383" />
									<p></p>
									<img src="images/alphago2.gif" align="middle" alt="" width="765" height="303" />
									<p></p>
									<p>This is true machine learning at work. Consider the unique strategies that both AIs came up with to battle their human opponents. In both cases, these world champions and the team of developers were unable to explain how these unique strategies came about. More than unusual, the AI were able to create strategies that no experienced human-player could counter or anticipate, leaving the AI resiliently dominant. This illustrates the potential for AI to exceed our own mental capacity. This seems powerful, incredible, and so...where’s the issue of conflict?</p>
									<img src="images/pong.gif" align="middle" alt="" width="765" height="572" />
									<p></p>
									<p>Let’s use a simple arcade game to illustrate the case. We can predict this game using known laws of physics. We can predict the position in advance with definite certainty. Even when the players in the system decide to be irrational in their play, we STILL know with certainty what’s happening and how to anticipate the path of the ball.  To an outsider without these known variables the game might appear haphazard or magical. If you imagine in the same way, that our financial market is a closed system with a huge but finite number of forces acting in it, for an AI with all of these “known” variables, there will be no randomness. It should be able to predict the path of the ball or in this case, the market.</p>
									<p>When you combine this idea with the concept of efficient markets (that all asset prices fully reflect all available information), then an AI should be able to obtain all the necessary inputs to accomplish its goal…namely, steady positive returns. What would that looks like? Well…sort of like…now:</p>
									<img src="images/slowsteady.png" align="middle" alt="" width="788" height="414" />
									<p></p>
									<p>The chart above shows the VIX (volatility index) vs the S&P500 (broader market) and indicates slow steady positive returns along with suppressed, low volatility. When programming trading bots and high-frequency trading machines, there is every incentive to push equity valuations ever higher, and no meaningful incentives to sell. Like our game of pong, even if one computer acts irrationally the rest can adjust quickly as they can predict all of the laws of the game.</p>
									<p>What brought about this synchronous behavior? For this I'll delve lightly into the concept of gradient descent...</p>
									<img src="images/graddescent.gif" align="middle" alt="" width="600" height="450" />
									<p></p>
									<p>What is gradient descent?</p>
									<blockquote> Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point. [wikipedia] </blockquote>
									<p>Let's try that again in english... Optimization is a big part of machine learning. Gradient descent is a mathematical procedure that determines that optimization path. For example, if you were at the top of a hill, and really really really drunk, but you know you need to get home but you're not sure exactly which way is down hill or up hill because the hill is very hilly... you'd simply take a small step, look around, and decide if you were lower or not before taking your next step--this is in contrast to simply, walking in one direction and hoping for the best; or trying tons of paths before finding the right one. Instead you make incremental steps towards your goal with the hope that eventually you reach your goal.</p>
									<p>Now imagine all the traders and machines are at the top of a hill (sober this time). And we start wandering in each of our own directions with each of our own maps ("models") but since we're all on the same hill ("the market") and trying to get to the same place ("make money"), there's not a likely situation where 50% of us go up the hill and 50% of us go down the hill; in fact, there's not a likely situation where even one person will break off from the group and go solo. Indeed anyone who suggested such would be preposterous, so at least, hopefully we can agree that our solutions may follow different paths to the same end, and that end would in theory be more like all of us clumped together at the bottom of the hill than randomly distributed otherwise.
									The herd here forms because we share the same inputs, and although we process them differently, we all seek to obtain the same goal.</p>
									<p>I think this is analogous to what is occurring in Western markets today (more so than rest-of-world) where investment and trading decisions are driven in-large by algorithms and data-driven models. But while we may only see this in isolated markets or during specific secular shifts in the market, it is my belief that as technology advances and computers/AI become more powerful and as data-driven strategies accumulate assets and influence, that this effect will increase, not subsist. It will become more observable and perhaps eventually we'll approach the financial singularity. I stop short here but want to explicitly recognize the realistic possibility Kurzweil's proposed--namely that we reach a point where artificial intelligence surpasses human intellect.
									Kurzweil foresees a world in which computers create the technology. They optimize what we need and how they'll make it and what it will do. There are no human inputs, there is no human "innovation." AlphaGO and OpenAI have showed us this is truly possible, and more so with human intervention. I remind the reader, that we refer to this potential technological advancement as a singularity because if it were to occur, just as the laws-of-physics break down in a black-hole singularity, we have no way of understanding the financial/technological world beyond its own singularity.</p>
									<p>In reality, I think the world that we shall see as technology continues to integrate itself with financial markets will be a mix of the world we live in today, and increasingly a larger mix of the forecasted financial singularity of the future. We are already seeing this today. As we look at global markets we can see indications where technology has embedded and changed market dynamics, but there are plenty of example where human folly, fear, and greed still drive price action. Noone knows for certainty what the future holds, but I know it will never be a dull day.</p>
