                                        <i>Summary: An analysis of MTA turnstile data showed us that peak traffic occurs at Grand Central Mon-Fri between 4-8pm with particular concentration around control unit R238. 
                                        With the hypothetical risk of a terrorist attack, we conclude that MTA should increase turnstile distribution and redistribute traffic volumes.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Warning/disclaimer: The situation herein described is a hypothetical construct. Any semblances with reality are purely coincidental
                                        as the goal was to conduct data analytics on an existing data set in a business context. </i>
                                        <br> <br>
                                        <p>I ride the subway every day. My commute is currently just under an hour, from Crown Heights
                                        where I live with my wife and soon-to-be-born daughter, to Metis near 28th and park ave in Manhattan.
                                        So when our first project was to analyze MTA turnstile data, my initial reaction was to seize on my own anxieties.
                                        New York is <b>CROWDED</b>. Having grown up in Oviedo, FL where we drive EVERWHERE, taking the subway is something I resisted
                                        for most of my decade as a New Yorker. Its crowded, smelly, dirty, and hot and humid during the summer. But its fast, inexpensive
                                        and an iconic element of New York.</p>
                                        <p> Usually I spend the first minute or so in a subway car assessing my surroundings--yes, "assessing." I want to know if there is a 
                                        dangerous or inebriated individual or someone who doesn't seem safe...plus as the MTA always says "If you see something, say
                                        something." So when given access to MTA's turnstile data, my thoughts led me to a hypothetical application: thwarting a terrorist attack in NYC.</p>
                                    
                                        <p> Let's look at the numbers:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>MTA daily ridership at more than 5 million commuters</li>
                                                <li>Annual downtown traffic is approximately 110 million people</li>
                                                <li>In 2017, there were more than 4000 transit related incidences</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        Those numbers are staggering, even for a New Yorker. More alarming, however, is the fact that the NYPD only have 40,000 
                                        uniformed officers to cover those 5 million commuters and only a measely 4,000 (~10%) work as transit officers--that means on average
                                        each officer deals with a transit incidence <b>EVERYDAY</b>.
                                        </p><p>
                                        Oh and this data by the way--and I do not intend this faceticiously--is the ugliest dataset I've seen to-date. I'd love to hear your horror stories but this is my first.
                                        As the saying goes, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and this project made me work for it. For starters, I took the negative turnstile counts, no doubt indicative
                                        of improperly installed meters, and used their absolute value count, removed all significant outliers (~2%) using a reasonable threshold of 100k commuters per a turnstile in
                                        a 4hr window of time. Missing values were backfilled as appropriate, using interpolation to ensure continuous, smooth distributions.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Let explore the data...</p>
                                        <p>The chart below shows the distribution of turnstile counts for the highest volume turnstiles around 42nd st/Grand Central/Times Square.
                                            The outliers--highlighted in red--are extreme. It should be obvious, for example that Port Authority doesn't have 2B+ commuters ever.

                                        <p>After removing the outliers, the first goal is to determine which station has the highest traffic, tagging it at-risk. 
                                            Grand Central wins with a fairly large margin:</p>
                                        <p><img src="images/trafficvol1696_978.png" alt="" width="800" height="462" /></p>
                                        <p>Next, looking at traffic in Grand Central by weekday, we can determine which day is riskiest. Here Thursday appears to be the most popular day to commute with the weekend falling off dramatically, presumably as commuters from NJ/Long Island/etc.
                                            return home for the weekend: </p>
                                        <p><img src="images/trafficvol1760_1012.png" alt="" width="800" height="460" /></p>
                                        <p> Finally we determine the distribution with respect to time so we can distribute the NYPD officers appropriately.
                                            Commuters wane from 8pm to 4am and then the pace increases throughout the day dropping slightly during lunch
                                            only to rally with the evening rush hour:
                                        </p>
                                        <p><img src="images/trafficvol1676_1006.png" alt="" width="800" height="480" /></p>
                                        <p>So far we've determined that if an attack were to occur during peak traffic in NYC, it would occur at Grand Central on a Thursday during the evening rush hour.
                                            I'm not quite satisfied with this data point. Grand Central is huge and it would still be a dramatic undertaking for a police force
                                            to comb through all of Grand Central. We need to narrow this down further...
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Breaking down the data into individual Grand Central turnstiles reveals an unusual result. Below is a heat-map where red-shading represents heavier traffic:</p>
                                        <p><img src="images/trafficvol1610_990.png" alt="" width="800" height="492" /></p>
                                        <p>It seems one turnstile gets an inordinate amount of traffic in Grand Central. If I were to take a guess, I suppose this is the turnstile adjacent to the
                                            escalators from the subway into Grand Central. This also makes it clear that there are asymmetric risks posed by the current layout.
                                            Its in the best interest of commuters, the NYPD, MTA, and New Yorkers to redistribute traffic flow in Grand Central. This would increase safety precautions
                                            and allow commuters to travel more efficiently. An immediate consideration perhaps, would be to post additional officers until resolved.
                                        </p>
