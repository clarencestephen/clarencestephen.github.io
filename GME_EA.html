                        </i></p>
                    <p>For GameStop…the struggle is real. Leadership issues, the growth of mobile and social gaming ,
                        online-shopping, and the rising popularity of digital downloads and DLCs (downloadable content)
                        have proved to be heavy headwinds for this struggling retailer whose linchpin is selling
                        physical, used-games. In contrast, EA has been a tremendous success story <a href=https://www.nasdaq.com/article/electronic-arts-and-the-star-wars-in-game-purchase-fiasco-cm880866>
                            <font style='color:red'>(in-game purchases aside)</font></a> riding the eSports waves to
                        the very top and delivering
                        consistent success with their franchise titles (Madden, FIFA, Mass Effect, Battlefield, et
                        al.).</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/4.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>This year has been tough for GameStop…In May, Former CEO Michael Mauler
                        resigned after only 3 months on the job (he replaced J. Paul Raines who had served as CEO
                        since 2010 and passed away in March). A few days after naming Mauler as CEO, GameStop fired
                        its COO and its executive VP of strategic business and brand development. Never a good
                        sign…</p>
                    <p>If you’ve ever been inside a GameStop, you are probably well aware of Game Informer, a gaming
                        publication with total circulation of ~7m and over 300 issues across almost 30 years—indeed,
                        their influence is apparent. But there is a somewhat subtle issue at hand: <i><b> the retailer
                                and the publisher are one and the same! </b></i> And unfortunately, GameStop
                        desperately needs to sell games, which creates a rather obvious conflict-of-interests…</p>

                    <p>Game Informer provides its readers with a reliable source of hype—ahem—I mean previews, reviews,
                        industry rumors, and news. The real issue lies in the review scores:</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/1.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>The chart above shows the distribution of all Game Informer review scores since 1994. The scores
                        are clustered
                        around 8 and skewed highly to the left. The kernel density estimation (KDE) line suggest all
                        games are likely to be highly rated. Are all games that good? Perhaps, this score-inflation is
                        a result of the technological and artistic
                        advancement of the gaming industry and the current state of high-quality of games?</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/2.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>The dot-plot above shows how consistent this heavy skew towards high scores has been since 1994.
                        If anything the
                        variance of scores has tightened more recently (fewer dots in lower right-hand region),
                        exacerbating any bias. To be clear: GameStop’s ultimate goal is to sell video
                        games; if they tell you every game is great, perhaps the assumption is that you’ll be more
                        likely to buy a video
                        game from them.</p>
                    <p>Is this really where you should be go for game reviews? Is Game Informer a reliable source for
                        honest, unbiased
                        reviews or is it just a proxy for Gamestop's advertising?
                        This consistent skew towards high review scores over 25 years should give us a reason to be
                        suspicious. And EA's review
                        scores appear to be no exception to the trend:</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/3.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>In order to investigate these trends further, I employed webscraping to obtain the review score
                        data and used
                        StatsModels and Scikit-Learn to build an evaluate the regression models.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/5.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>Let's explore the data further...</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/6.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>The chart above shows the distribution of EA stock returns, relative to the S&P500, 7 days after
                        a review is
                        published for one of their games. As the (weak) trend line suggests, EA stock tends to perform
                        better after higher review scores.
                        And as one might expect, scores of 6 or lower have some outsized negative returns. But the
                        issue still
                        remains at the higher end, with a dense cluster of high scores and less-correlated returns.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, the distribution of the target variable (EA stock returns) appears very normal:</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/7.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>And recent years indicate tighter returns (lower volatility) around weekly reviews:</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/8.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>This trend holds for a wider return period as well (30 days):</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/9.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>But we want to understand how much of this stock behavior is influenced by Game Informer
                        reviews. To that end,
                        the most important and perhaps obvious component to include in our model feature-selection is
                        today's stock price.
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/10.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>The chart above shows the strong linear relationship between today's closing price and the 7-day
                        forward price (correlation coefficient of 0.99609).
                        This holds true for the 30-day forward price as well (correlation coefficient of 0.98605),
                        confirming our base-line assumptions.
                        Having applied the train-test-split process to the data, and using closing prices and 7-day
                        forward prices as initial inputs
                        for a simple linear regression yields an R^2 value of 0.972 as baseline.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/12.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>From the baseline model, adding additional features including the review scores, takes R^2 down
                        to 0.970.
                        This should not be a surprise as the additional features 'dilute' the aforementioned linear
                        relationship between
                        closing and future pricing as well as introducing some noise from features such as trading
                        volumes. However, this linear model applies
                        a coefficient of -0.15 to review scores. This direction and magnitude suggest the relationship
                        between the review scores
                        and the 7 day stock returns may not be linear (or that the review scores have a tiny negative
                        impact),
                        and thus a polynomial regression yeilds a better fit at R^2 0.976.

                    <p>Examining the model more closely, we can observe some heteroskedasticity at the lower range of
                        closing prices up until $40.
                        Those prices correspond with where EA stock traded before 2014. Recall, this period also
                        represents higher volatility in
                        the underlying stock. So appropriately, as stock volatility decreased the model is able to make
                        better predictions (proportionally lower residuals) at higher prices.
                        Residuals remain around +/- $5 above $40 so with EA stock currently trading ~$105, thats not
                        terrible accuracy.

                    <p> EA stock is up nearly 500% since 2013. So what happened at EA? What led to lower volatility and
                        higher prices? Certainly nothing had changed with regard
                        to the pattern of their game review scores, as shown in the early charts.

                    <p>Andrew Wilson happened. Six months after the resignation of John Riccitiello, Andrew Wilson was
                        chosen to be the new CEO of EA on September 17, 2013.
                        His leadership led to increased profitability and reduced stock volatility. Andrew Wilson had
                        been head of EA sports and took the CEO helm amid
                        a leadership shakeup and mass layoffs. He came off the heels of success with Madden & FIFA and
                        brought his vision to the entire company.

                    <p>But back to our model...</p>
                    <p>The influence of Game Informer review scores on EA stock price seems small at first. Recall adding this feature improved on the baseline linear
                        model with R^2 0.972 by only 0.004, with the polynomial regression scoring 0.976. But the influence is there! 
                        Looking at "the best" vs "the worst" scores...scores below 5 had an average 7 day return of -3%, where as scores of 9 or better returned +1%.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/GME_EA/19.png" alt="" style="width:100%" /></p>
                    <p>Digging a little deeper into the best and worst EA stock returns we can see the best performers had scores skewed towards 8+ (avg 7.8 review score). 
                        Conversely, for the worst performers, scores were skewed sub 8 (avg 7.3) with some of the worst reviews in this group (Tiger Woods 99 scored 2!).
                    </p>
                    <p>The primary purpose of this project was to deploy large-scale webscraping and implement the data in an autoregressive model. Having accomplished this purpose, 
                        I will stop short of any grandiose conclusions with regards to Game Informer reviews. The influence is apparent albeit small and--full disclosure--I am
                        a subscriber to this magazine. I read it for entertainment not review scores. And at least with EA, it should be safe to say the stock performs mostly
                        on the overall quality of its game offerings, rather than the influence of individual reviews.
